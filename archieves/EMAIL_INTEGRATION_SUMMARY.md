# Email Integration for Drone Delivery Service

## Overview

We have successfully integrated email notification functionality into the Drone Delivery Service using MailerSend. This integration allows the system to send real email notifications to customers when their orders are processed and delivered.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Email Service Provider

After evaluating multiple options (Gmail SMTP, Brevo, etc.), we chose MailerSend as our email service provider due to its:
- Simple setup process
- Reliable delivery
- Free tier for testing
- Support for both SMTP and API methods

### 2. Integration Methods

We've implemented two methods for sending emails:

#### a. SMTP Integration
- Uses standard SMTP protocol
- Server: smtp.mailersend.net
- Port: 587 (TLS)
- Credentials from MailerSend account

#### b. API Integration
- Uses REST API
- Provides more detailed delivery tracking
- Simpler implementation
- Uses bearer token authentication

By default, the service uses the API method as it's more reliable and provides better logging.

### 3. Configuration

The email functionality can be configured using environment variables in the docker-compose file:

```yaml
EMAIL_ENABLED: "true"
EMAIL_HOST: "smtp.mailersend.net"
EMAIL_PORT: "587"
EMAIL_USER: "MS_FSeNj8@trial-r6ke4n1xr63gon12.mlsender.net"
EMAIL_PASSWORD: "mssp.c15zPmM.3zxk54vnek6ljy6v.175bFNr"
EMAIL_FROM: "MS_FSeNj8@trial-r6ke4n1xr63gon12.mlsender.net"
EMAIL_FROM_NAME: "Drone Delivery Service"
MAILERSEND_API_KEY: "mlsn.6bdfb137652a12742bf620598b7374f59e91fb2f64b88e42636680365ffb92fc"
USE_MAILERSEND_API: "true"
```

### 4. Email Format

The emails sent by the system include:
- HTML and plain text versions for compatibility
- Order details
- Delivery status
- Professional styling
- Company branding

### 5. Testing

A test endpoint has been added to the notification service to verify email functionality:
```
GET /test-email?email=customer@example.com
```

This makes it easy to test the email functionality without having to process a complete order.

## How to Test the Integration

1. Rebuild the notification service:
   ```
   docker compose -f docker-compose_mac.yml up -d --build notification
   ```

2. Send a test email using the test endpoint:
   ```
   curl "http://localhost:5300/test-email?email=your.email@example.com"
   ```

3. Process a test order to trigger the notification:
   ```
   python test_full_order_flow.py
   ```

## Future Improvements

1. Add email templates for different notification types
2. Implement email delivery tracking and analytics
3. Add customer preference settings for notification methods
4. Add attachments (e.g., invoice PDFs, delivery receipts)
5. Implement email queue for handling high volumes

## Troubleshooting

If emails are not being delivered:

1. Check notification service logs:
   ```
   docker logs esd-main-notification-1
   ```

2. Verify the environment variables are correctly set in docker-compose_mac.yml

3. Ensure the MailerSend account is active and has sufficient sending quota

4. Test the SMTP connection directly:
   ```python
   python -c "import smtplib; server=smtplib.SMTP('smtp.mailersend.net', 587); server.starttls(); server.login('MS_FSeNj8@trial-r6ke4n1xr63gon12.mlsender.net', 'mssp.c15zPmM.3zxk54vnek6ljy6v.175bFNr'); print('Success!')"
   ```
